**Generated**: 2025-11-25T01:39:44.380Z

## Performance Analysis

### Current State
- **Bundle Size**: Needs assessment
- **Load Time**: Target < 3 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: Target < 200MB
- **First Contentful Paint**: Target < 1.5 seconds

### Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Bundle Size Optimization
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Minify CSS and JavaScript
- [ ] Enable gzip compression

#### 2. Loading Performance
- [ ] Implement lazy loading
- [ ] Add service worker for caching
- [ ] Optimize image assets
- [ ] Reduce initial payload

#### 3. Runtime Performance
- [ ] Optimize rendering pipeline
- [ ] Reduce reflows and repaints
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large files
- [ ] Optimize font loading

### Implementation Priority
1. **High Impact, Low Effort**: Service worker, minification
2. **High Impact, Medium Effort**: Code splitting, lazy loading
3. **Medium Impact, High Effort**: Architecture optimization
