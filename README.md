# Gemini Workspace

## 🚀 Overview
This workspace contains the core development environment for the **Agentic Strategic Planning** system, including the **UltraThink** orchestration engine and the **Unified Orchestrator** (`orch`).

## 📚 Documentation
The central documentation hub is located in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory.
- **[Start Here](docs/README.md)**: Main entry point for all documentation.
- **[Agentic Strategic Planning](docs/architecture/AGENTIC_STRATEGIC_PLANNING.md)**: Core formalisms and system architecture.
- **[UltraThink System](docs/ultrathink-system/)**: AI task orchestration and reliability engine.

## 🛠️ Key Tools
- **`orch`**: The unified command-line interface for agent delegation and workflow management.
- **`ultrathink`**: The deep analysis and reliable execution engine (v6.1).

## 🏗️ Architecture
The system follows the **Automated Construction Firm** model:
- **Blueprint**: SCIP Graph (Structured Context)
- **Architect**: Gemini 3 (Planning)
- **Controller**: Marginal Utility Convergence (Cost/Value)
- **Cockpit**: Live State Object (LSO) for observability

## 📦 Quick Start
```bash
# Run the orchestrator
./scripts/orch "Your task here"

# Run deep analysis
./scripts/orch --deep "Complex architectural task"
```
